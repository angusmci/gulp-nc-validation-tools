# README

## Overview

This is a simple library for use with [`gulp`](https://gulpjs.org/) that provides some utility functions for validating JSON and other data files.

This is NOT a finished library. It's a set of thrown-together functions for use in my own projects. If it's useful to you, that's great, but it's not a finished or polished product, and it's subject to alteration or even removal without notice.

## Usage

TBD
